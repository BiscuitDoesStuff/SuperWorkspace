# Workspace agent instructions

## Project identity

Workspace is a research-led AI workspace based on the research in the sibling
`AI-Research [2]` project, not on preserving the inherited SuperWorkspace design.
Read only the Startup section of `docs/workspace-state.md` at startup; it owns
implemented state and current authorization. `docs/workspace-outline.md` is the
single project design rules/assumptions register; read its detail on demand.
Research informs decisions, not automatic implementation authority.

## Design authority and current implementation

- Everything in this project can be modified, overhauled or replaced based on
  new research, data and owner decisions, including these instructions, inherited
  policies, kit sources, generated definitions, architecture and tooling. Nothing
  has privileged preservation status because it is inherited or kit-managed.
- Current operational rules still govern execution until an approved change
  revises them. Their status, provenance, assumptions and revision triggers belong
  in the design register; proposals and evidence gaps are not binding rules.
- While the current generator is in use, its sources are `project/`, `lib/`,
  `global/` and `sw.ps1`; `.sw/manifest.json` lists generated definitions. Change
  the source or explicitly replace that mechanism, rather than silently create
  a competing copy. This is a current mechanism, not a permanent architecture.
- `docs/workspace-state.md` owns current state; `.sw/comms/tasks/` owns execution
  evidence. Research findings, proposals, approvals and verified behavior remain
  distinct. A research-led direction alone authorizes no overhaul, installation,
  external corpus edit, global setting change or publication.

## Required startup

The harness auto-loads this file; do not re-read it. Before a meaningful change:

1. Read the project state file named in Project identity, startup section only.
2. Run `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -10`; inspect the
   existing implementation relevant to the task before editing.
3. Confirm the work is authorized. A roadmap, backlog, or old record is not
   approval. If Git contradicts recorded state, stop instead of guessing.

## Principles

- Preserve working behavior before adding new behavior.
- Smallest independently testable change; reuse before writing; no unrelated
  refactors or speculative scope. Load `minimal-change` when implementing.
- Never claim a check, manual test, or publication that did not happen.
- No third-party assets, plugins, or dependencies without explicit approval.
- Do not add systems because they seem like the natural next step; new scope
  needs explicit planning and approval.

## Validation

Choose checks by changed scope. Workspace/docs-only work runs
`pwsh -NoProfile -File .sw/sw.ps1 validate` and `git diff --check`. Code work
follows the profile section below. Report exact commands and outcomes, and keep
automated, headless, and manual results separate. Fix failures your change
caused; report others without broad repairs.

## Git

- Only `main` and owner-designated `<user>/<user>-worktree` branches exist
  (solo projects: `main` only); no task, feature, review, sandbox, or automatic
  branches. Never work on another contributor's branch. Unexpected branches
  are reported, never deleted.
- Never discard, reset, stash, clean, or overwrite existing work. Commit only
  when explicitly asked. Agents never push; humans publish their own branch.
- GitHub writes follow the tier in `.sw/config.json` (see `.sw/workspace.md`).
- Stage selected paths only; never `git add .` in a shared checkout.

## Workspace

OpenCode is the shared harness; other harnesses are optional local adapters.
`.sw/workspace.md` owns roles, approved-plan execution, permissions, tiers, and
runtime checks. `.sw/collaboration.md` owns task records, messages, branches,
and integration. Credentials, machine paths, and model choices stay local.

## Profile: generic

Validation order for code changes: (1) the project's build or type check,
(2) its automated tests, targeted first, then the suite, (3) manual or
interactive checks only when a real session exists, (4) `git diff --check` and
trailing-whitespace checks on new files. Discover the actual commands from the
repository (README, package manifest, CI workflow) instead of assuming them.
