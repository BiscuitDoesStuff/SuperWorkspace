# Collaboration

Owns task records, messages, branches, publication, and integration under
`AGENTS.md`. Git is the transport: everything below is plain files in
`.sw/comms/`, published when a human pushes their branch. `main` is the
integration baseline. Only humans publish; agents never push.

## Layout

```
.sw/comms/
  tasks/<task-id>/<UTC>-<user>-<event>.md   immutable task events
  inbox/<user>/<UTC>-<from>-<slug>.md       messages to one person or model
  archive/<task-id>/SUMMARY.md              closed tasks, one page each
  archive/inbox/<user>/                     read messages
```

`sw comms` writes these for you (`send`, `inbox`, `event`, `close`, `archive`).
UTC stamps use `yyyy-MM-ddTHHmmssZ`. Never edit another author's file; add a
correction event instead. Your own unsubmitted event may be revised.

## Task events

Events: `assignment`, `progress`, `submission`, `correction`, `review`,
`approval`, `integration`, `receipt`, `closure`. One task directory per task; no
second plan, memory, or TODO hierarchy. Harness memory (Claude auto memory,
Codex memories) is machine-local recall; anything the team or a later session
needs goes in a task record or a committed file. Fields:

```markdown
# <task-id> - <event> - <UTC> - <author>

- **Author / audience:** <human owner; agent/model if relevant; readers>
- **Approval:** <who approved what, when, source; or "proposal, not approved">
- **Scope / acceptance:** <outcome, success evidence, exclusions>
- **Status:** <pending | in_progress | complete | blocked; why>
- **Branch / base:** <user/user-worktree>; published main <full SHA, when observed>
- **Checked revision / changed:** <full SHA plus dirty paths, or "uncommitted draft over <SHA>">
- **Owners / dependencies:** <file, binary-asset, validation owners; dependencies and their state>
- **Decisions / remaining:** <choices made, work done, next items>
- **Validation:** <runner; time/zone; exact command; result; evidence location>
- **Not validated / risks:** <missing or failed checks; reported vs observed>
- **Publication:** <local-only, or observed published ref + full SHA>
- **Next action:** <owner; executable step; completion evidence>
```

`blocked` names the unmet dependency and what unblocks it; `complete` needs
acceptance evidence and is not publication. On resume, reconcile the latest
events with Git and the actual files, not just the status field. Context
summaries and model switches do not carry uncommitted work. Never guess the SHA
of the commit that will contain a record.

**Claims.** A task is claimed when its `assignment` event is on `main`; if two
people assign the same task, the first fast-forward push wins and the other
reconciles. At GitHub tier 1 an assignment may name an issue and its assignee,
but the record stays the truth. With recorded contributors, task IDs start with
the owner's user name (`<user>-<slug>`) so two people never create the same
folder.

**Closing.** When a task is integrated, `sw comms close <task-id>` writes
`archive/<task-id>/SUMMARY.md` (outcome, final SHA, decisions, open follow-ups)
and moves the events beside it. Agents read the summary, not the old events, so
closed work stops costing context. `-Outcome` is the whole summary: give the
outcome, the decisions and the open follow-ups. Close a task only after its last
event is on `main`.

## Multi-session work (optional)

One Leader session per human writes assignments; worker sessions, opened by that
human, each own one package. The task record is the truth. "Go" and "done"
travel by harness messaging where it exists, else the human relays them. A
Leader is never shared between humans and assigns only tasks its human owns.
Across humans, coordination travels as files (a message in `inbox/<user>/` or a
task event, published by push and received by fetch) or, at GitHub tier 1, as
an issue comment.

## Messages

A message is for coordination between people or models: questions, requests,
FYIs. It carries no authority: approval happens in a task `approval` event or
directly from the human owner. Fields: `from`, `to`, `task` (optional),
`subject`, body, and the action requested. Read with `/inbox` or
`sw comms inbox`; archive once handled.

## Branches

Only `main` and owner-designated `<user>/<user>-worktree` branches exist
(`sw user add <name>` records a contributor; the owner runs it on `main`). With
no recorded contributors (`users` is empty in `.sw/config.json`) the owner
works on `main` directly and the integrate flow is not needed. Once anyone is
recorded, everyone, the owner included, works on their own branch. Each
contributor works, commits, and publishes only on their own branch. The owner supplies the contributor name;
never infer it from a path or old commit. A worktree uses an existing assigned
branch that is not checked out elsewhere. A dirty tree means stop and
coordinate, never reset or stash.

Agent-made branches stay off: Claude's desktop worktree option and
`--worktree`, OpenCode automatic worktrees, Codex cloud tasks and the Copilot
cloud agent each create their own branch per task, outside this model. For
binary assets in LFS projects, `git lfs lock` optionally enforces the
one-owner rule.

## Finish and publish (human)

Stage selected task paths only; inspect `git diff --cached` for unrelated work
and secrets; commit with a Conventional Commit message (`feat:`, `fix:`,
`docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`). A local commit is local until the
human pushes their branch and confirms the remote tip. Announce:

```text
Task: <task-id>; author: <user>
Published ref: refs/heads/<user>/<user>-worktree @ <full SHA observed after push>
Base: <full main SHA>; record: .sw/comms/tasks/<task-id>/<event>.md
Validation: <summary>; blockers/next: <owner and action>
```

## Integrate (human)

After `/validate` passes on the published task SHA:

```powershell
git fetch origin
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main <task-sha>   # exit 0 required
git switch main
git merge --ff-only origin/main
git merge --ff-only <task-sha>
git push origin main
```

If the ancestry check fails, merge `origin/main` into **your** contributor
branch, resolve conflicts by intent, revalidate, publish, and retry. Never
force-push, rebase a published branch, or reset. With GitHub tier 1 the same
rule holds: a PR is a review surface, and a human merges it.

**Protect main (human, once).** Branch protection is the real control on
`main`; the kit prints these steps and never applies them. In the repository
settings, add a branch ruleset for the default branch:

- Solo: block force pushes, restrict deletions, and allow no bypass (admins
  included). Do not require pull requests or status checks; both block
  direct commits to `main`.
- Team: also require the status check `validate` (from `sw-validate.yml`),
  with the branch up to date. Requiring pull requests is optional and needs
  the integrator to bypass it.
- Private repositories need GitHub Pro or an organization plan for this;
  public ones get it on Free.

## Receive

Fetch, check `git status` is clean, and fast-forward only when your HEAD is an
ancestor of `origin/main`; divergent unintegrated commits need deliberate
reconciliation on your branch. For LFS projects run `git lfs pull` before
building. Publication, receipt, build, automated checks, and manual checks are
separate facts.

**Kit updates.** `sw update` changes shared files for everyone, so the owner
(or a named contributor) runs it from the kit clone on their branch as a task,
validates, and integrates it like any change. Others receive it; Claude users
then run `sw claude enable` to regenerate their local `.claude/`, which
`sw validate` reports as drift until they do.
